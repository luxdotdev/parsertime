It got me to understand more about statistics in general and really get interested in data science, which I now do for four teams (using Parsertime). The information it provides is so impactful that my players can be coached on things they actively need help with, like surviving longer, holding their ultimate abilities longer, and being more patient. Maybe their healing numbers are lower than the other support, so we can look at why. It's a fantastic tool that helps obtain a wider range of data to lock in on a closer field of view.”",
